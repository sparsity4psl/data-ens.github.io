**Kernel Methods for Surrogate Modelling**  
 *Abstract*: Kernel methods are a very efficient class of algorithms
 in numerical analysis and machine learning.
 For example they allow function interpolation or approximation,
 PDE solution by collocation, data analysis by
 classification, regression and novelty detection.
 From a theoretical viewpoint they have a functional analytical
 background in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), that allows
 error and convergence analysis.
 Common goal for efficiency is sparsity in the kernel expansions.
 Apart from well known sparsity-inducing optimization targets, also
 greedy techniques are of high interest.
 We will present the theory and application of such methods,
 with particular focus on surrogate modelling.
